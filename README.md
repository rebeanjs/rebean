# Rebean Redux

Reusable redux behaviors.

## Concept

Redux is a powerful tool - it's able to describe complex state transformations in a very clean way.
Despite this, we still write a basic behavior models in each project instead of reusing them.
That's where idea of reusable redux packages comes from.
