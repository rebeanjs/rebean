Reusable Redux behaviors.

## Concept

Redux is a powerful tool - it's able to describe complex state transformations in a very clean way.
Despite this, we still write a basic behavior models in each project instead of reusing them.
That's where idea of reusable redux packages comes from.

## Packages

[@rebean/redux-snackbar](packages/redux-snackbar)

## Publish

1. Lunch the `npm run lerna:version` command on the master branch.
2. Push changes to the remote repository - CI will publish changes to the NPM automatically ðŸš€
